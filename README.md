# bonVoyage

(This was completed as a capstone project while at Launch Academy)

bonVoyage is a travelerâ€™s social media platform where users can connect with one another and plan their next trip by discovering new destinations. On the landing page, a user is able to utilize an interactive world map which redirects them to the selected country's show page where they can post questions about a planned upcoming trip. Information about popular cities with suggested destinations and forms to search for flights and hotels can be found across the site. bonVoyage is a perfect resource for any individual looking for information on their next travel destination.

## Future (Dream) Features
- Create an itinerary planner tool using Amadeus API and Google Places API. A user will be able to create a trip and select specific destinations using a dynamic form. Suggested flights and hotels will be generated for each destination the user specifies and saved to the user's profile. 
- Add more functionality to the forum section including nested comments and notifications for when users reply to posts and comments.
